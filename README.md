# heraldstack-core

Ambient AI infrastructure for multi-platform agent collectives. Four CLI platforms (Claude Code, kiro, goose, Gemini) routed through herald agents, backed by unified knowledge backbone (qdrant vector store, valkey cache), full OpenTelemetry tracing, rust-first application logic.

## status

public

## what this is

- Unified knowledge backbone: qdrant collections (copywriting, writing-inbox, shared-knowledge, prompt-transcripts, agent-memory, shannon-methodology, verbal-ticks)
- Core utilities: JSON schema validation, markdown formatting, naming convention enforcement, JSONL ingestion tooling
- AI entity definitions: nine herald agent personas with Marvel-inspired AI references
- Deployment scripts and validation tools (all new features in Rust, not shell scripts)
- Ethics guidelines, development principles, naming conventions, architecture decision records

## architecture

Four agent platforms (shannon/haunting/gander/ibeji) share knowledge via streaming HTTP to persistent MCP endpoints. Herald routes context to specialists. Qdrant stores chunked embeddings (character-based chunks, HNSW indexing). Valkey caches frequent queries. Jaeger collects OpenTelemetry traces. All application logic written in Rust. Shell scripts limited to deployment orchestration (aws-cli, docker, ci/cd)
